## Flashing your Bios and Important Notes
- Make sure the card is STABLE, set to lowest clock with nvidia-smi. IF THERE IS A WARNING DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FLASH, this will corrupt inforom and require recovery under linux
- Avoid using HP bioses, these limit to pcie gen2 and mess with inforom configuration.
- A clean INFOROM template is provided for recovery purposes
- Flashing a GPU BIOS always carries risk â€“ make sure you have a backup and recovery method before proceeding.  

  **Window Commands Template**:
  ```
  nvidia-smi -i <your index here> -ac 324,324
  & ".\nvflash64.exe" --protectoff --index=<your index here>
  & ".\nvflash64.exe" -6 ".\<bios name goes here>.rom" --index=<your index here>
  ```

  **After Reboot**
  ```
  nvidia-smi -i <your index here> -ac 3500,1124
  ```
