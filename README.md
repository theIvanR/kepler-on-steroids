# 0: NVIDIA Tesla K40c "Ultra" BIOS Mod

The **NVIDIA Tesla K40** remains a formidable GPU for compute workloads, featuring **2880 CUDA cores**, dual-issue pipelines (2 IPC), and robust memory bandwidth. This repository provides modified BIOS files that unlock additional voltage, power, and clock headroom beyond factory constraints.

# 1: Comparison of Bioses
```
# Stock BIOS:
SYS / GPC Clocks      : 875 MHz
Xbar / L2c Clocks     : 787.5 MHz
Memory Effective      : 3000 MHz
Voltage (P0)          : 925 mV
TDP Range             : 150W – 235W
```

```
# A: CUDA BIOS (stable under extreme CUDA + FurMark) -> work in progresss, testing
SYS / GPC Clocks      : 1071.5 MHz  # +196.5 MHz over stock
Xbar / L2c Clocks     : 1025 MHz    # +262.5 MHz over stock
Memory Effective      : 3500 MHz    # +500 MHz over stock
Voltage (P0)          : 925 mV      # +0 mV over stock
TDP Range             : 150W – 300W
```

```
# B: Casual Use BIOS (stable under FurMark / Vulkan) -> one currently provided
SYS / GPC Clocks      : 1124 MHz    # +249 MHz over stock
Xbar / L2c Clocks     : 1050 MHz    # +262.5 MHz over stock
Memory Effective      : 3500 MHz    # +500 MHz over stock
Voltage (P0)          : 950 mV      # +25 mV over stock
TDP Range             : 150W – 300W
```

```
# C: Extreme BIOS (maximum theoretical performance, some instability)
SYS / GPC Clocks      : 1200+ MHz   # +325+ MHz over stock, may vary
Xbar / L2c Clocks     : 1100+ MHz   # +312.5+ MHz over stock
Memory Effective      : 3500 MHz    # +500 MHz over stock
Voltage (P0)          : 975 mV+     # +50+ mV over stock
TDP Range             : 150W – 300W+

#3: Flashing your Bios and Important Notes
- Make sure the card is STABLE, set to lowest clock with nvidia-smi. IF THERE IS A WARNING DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FLASH, this will corrupt inforom and require recovery under linux
- Avoid using HP bioses, these limit to pcie gen2 and mess with inforom configuration.
- A clean INFOROM template is provided for recovery purposes
- Flashing a GPU BIOS always carries risk – make sure you have a backup and recovery method before proceeding.  

  **Window Commands Template**:
  ```
  nvidia-smi -i <your index here> -ac 324,324
  & ".\nvflash64.exe" --protectoff --index=<your index here>
  & ".\nvflash64.exe" -6 ".\<bios name goes here>.rom" --index=<your index here>
  ```

  **After Reboot**
  ```
  nvidia-smi -i <your index here> -ac 3500,1124
  ```

## Disclaimer
This repository serves as a reference for:
- Computer architecture research
- Hardware modification education
- Preservation of legacy computing techniques

This BIOS and inforom is provided **as-is** with no warranty.  
While this bios is stable in good faith on my silicon (5 hours Furmark), the flashing is at your own risk. Act accordingly and proceed with caution.
